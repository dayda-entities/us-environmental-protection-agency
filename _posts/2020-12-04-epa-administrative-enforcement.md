The EPA Administrative Enforcement Dockets database contains the electronic dockets for administrative penalty cases filed by EPA Regions and Headquarters. Visitors can browse the dockets by year, by statute, EPA region, or a via a free text search. It should be noted that in some cases, particularly prior to 2008, dockets have not yet been published electronically. For users looking for information not included on the website, please contact the Regional Hearing Clerk where the case was filed.
