This dataset contains the sub-model for EPA's MARKAL model, which tracks methane emissions from the energy system, and limited other sources (landfills and manure handling). This dataset includes projections of future methane emissions from the energy system out to 2030 and potential mitigation levels of methane emissions by energy system component. See the full report at http://www.epa.gov/methane/projections.html.
