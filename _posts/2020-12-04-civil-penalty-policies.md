The Environmental Protection Agency's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) website provides customizable and downloadable information about environmental inspections, violations, and enforcement actions for EPA-regulated facilities, like power plants and factories. ECHO advances public information by sharing data related to facility compliance with and regulatory agency activity related to air, hazardous waste, clean water, and drinking water regulations. ECHO offers many user-friendly options to explore data, including:
1. Facility Search (http://echo.epa.gov/facilities/facility-search?mediaSelected=all): ECHO information is searchable by varied criteria, including location, facility type, and compliance status related to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act. Search results are customizable and downloadable.
2. Comparative Maps (http://echo.epa.gov/maps/state-comparative-maps) and State Dashboards (http://echo.epa.gov/trends/comparative-maps-dashboards/state-air-dashboard): These tools offer aggregated information about facility compliance status and regulatory agency compliance monitoring and enforcement activity at the national and state level.
3. Bulk Data Downloads (http://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/data-downloads): One of ECHO's most popular features is the ability to work offline by downloading large data sets. Users can take advantage of the ECHO Exporter, which provides summary information about each facility in a comma-separated format. Additionally, data sets by program also are available as zip files. These are updated weekly as part of the ECHO data refresh.
