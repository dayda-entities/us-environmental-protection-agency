The RadNet Real-Time Monitoring Spectrometry Data Inventory contains measured data used to identify and measure specific radioactive materials in the atmosphere at locations across the United States. This data is only collected from the monitors based on a triggered response requirement.The statutory authority leading to the collection of this information comes from Title I Section XII of the Clean Air Act and Title I Chapter XIV of the Atomic Energy Act.Substance classes include Radionuclides and HAPs.Hourly measured data that shows an abnormality is manually downloaded from the monitor the next business day.
