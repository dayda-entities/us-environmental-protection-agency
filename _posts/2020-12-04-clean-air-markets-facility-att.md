The Facility Attributes and Contacts Query Wizard is part of a suite of Clean Air Markets-related tools that are accessible at https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd.  The Facility Attributes and Contact module gives the user access to current and historical facility, owner, and representative data using custom queries, via the Facility Attributes Query Wizard, or Quick Reports. In addition, data regarding EPA, State, and local agency staff are also available. The Query Wizard can be used to search for data about a facility or facilities by identifying characteristics such as associated programs, owners, representatives, locations, and unit characteristics, facility inventories, and classifications.

EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) includes several market-based regulatory programs designed to improve air quality and ecosystems. The most well-known of these programs are EPA's Acid Rain Program and the NOx Programs, which reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compounds that adversely affect air quality, the environment, and public health. CAMD also plays an integral role in the development and implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).
