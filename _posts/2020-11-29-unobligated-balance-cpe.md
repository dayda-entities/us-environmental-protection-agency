The definition for this element appears in Section 20 of OMB Circular A-11 issued June 2015; a brief summary from A-11 appears below.

Unobligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for obligation under law in unexpired accounts. The term “expired balances available for adjustment only” refers to unobligated amounts in expired accounts.
