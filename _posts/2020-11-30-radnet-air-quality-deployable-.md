RadNet Deployable Monitoring is designed to collect radiological and meteorological information and data asset needed to establish the impact of radiation levels on the environment. The RadNet Deployable System has been designed as a tool for radiological emergency response and can be used to support the current fixed stations of the EPA's RadNet monitoring network. It can also be used as a tool for monitoring areas associated with a real or perceived nuclear or radiological threat.
