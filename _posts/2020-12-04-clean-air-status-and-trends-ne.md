The CASTNET Download Data module allows users to select, view, and download CASTNET data (Raw, Aggregate, Modeled & Factual Data) based on user selections.
  
CASTNET sites are located in or near rural areas and sensitive ecosystems collecting data on ambient levels of pollutants where urban influences are minimal. CASTNET, which was initiated in 1986, is able to provide data needed to assess and report on geographic patterns and long-term temporal trends in ambient air pollution and dry atmospheric deposition. CASTNET can also be used to track changes in measurements associated with climate change (such as temperature and precipitation).
