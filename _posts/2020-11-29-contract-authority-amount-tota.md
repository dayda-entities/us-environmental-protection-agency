The definition for this element appears in Section 20 of OMB Circular A-11 issued June 2015; a brief summary from A-11 appears below.

Contract authority is a type of budget authority that permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. Typically, the Congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the obligations.
