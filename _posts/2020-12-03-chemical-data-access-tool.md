This tool is intended to aid individuals interested in learning more about chemicals that are manufactured or imported into the United States. Health and safety information on these chemicals,  primarily in the form of paper documents,  are routinely submitted by industry (manufacturers or importers of chemicals) to EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  EPA is in the process of converting these documents into electronic form and making non-confidential versions of these documents accessible through this tool.  The tool enables users to conduct both full text and metadata searches of these documents,  and presents these as .pdf for viewing or downloading.  The tool also queries existing EPA legacy database sources of chemical information and presents these data in a consistent format.
