The Allowances Query Wizard is part of a suite of Clean Air Markets-related tools that are accessible at https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd. The Allowances module allows the user to view allowance data associated with EPA's emissions trading programs. Allowance data can be specified and organized using the Allowance Query Wizard to find allowances information associated with specific accounts, companies, transactions, programs, facilities, representatives, allowance type, or by date. Quick Reports and Prepackaged Datasets are also available for data that are commonly requested.

EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) includes several market-based regulatory programs designed to improve air quality and ecosystems. The most well-known of these programs are EPA's Acid Rain Program and the NOx Programs, which reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compounds that adversely affect air quality, the environment, and public health. CAMD also plays an integral role in the development and implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).
