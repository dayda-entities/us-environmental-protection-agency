The National Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory contains information on direct emissions of greenhouse gases as well as indirect or potential emissions of greenhouse gases through fuels combustion or oxidation, plus releases from storage or sequestration facilities, compiled on an annual basis. Substance classes principally include include CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. The 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Act are the statutory basis behind this data. Reporting includes nine sectors. Data is  contributed by reporting industrial and commercial sources of more than 25,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. It is also estimated and modeled for transportation and other sources which are geographically distributed.
