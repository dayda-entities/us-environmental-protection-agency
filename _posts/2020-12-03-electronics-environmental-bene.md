The Electronics Environmental Benefits Calculator (EEBC) was developed to assist organizations in estimating the environmental benefits of greening their purchase,  use and disposal of electronics.

The EEBC estimates the environmental and economic benefits of: Purchasing Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)-registered products; Enabling power management features on computers and monitors above default percentages;  Extending the life of equipment beyond baseline values;  Reusing computers,  monitors and cell phones; and Recycling computers,  monitors,  cell phones and loads of mixed electronic products.

The EEBC may be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
