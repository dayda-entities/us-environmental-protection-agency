The amount of goods and/or services ordered and obligated in one Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS) and transferred to or from another TAFS, which have not been actually or constructively received and not prepaid or advanced at the time of transfer. This includes amounts specified in other contracts or agreements such as grants, program subsidies, undisbursed loans and claims, and similar events for which an advance or prepayment has not occurred. Although the normal balance for this account is credit, it is acceptable for this account to have a debit balance. (Per USSGL TFM Part 2, Section II, Accounts and Definitions.)
