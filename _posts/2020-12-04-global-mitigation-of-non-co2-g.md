Marginal abatement curves (MAC) can be downloaded as data annexes to the Global Mitigation of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases report. This data allows for improved understanding of the mitigation potential for non-CO2 sources, as well as inclusion of non-CO2 greenhouse gas mitigation in economic modeling of multigas mitigation strategies. The full report at http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/international.html.
