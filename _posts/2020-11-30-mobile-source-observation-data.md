The Mobile Source Observation Database (MSOD) is a relational database being developed by the Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) of the US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Transportation and Air Quality (formerly the Office of Mobile Sources). The MSOD contains emission test data from in-use mobile air- pollution sources such as cars, trucks, and engines from trucks and nonroad vehicles. Data in the database was collected from 1982 to the present. The data is intended to be representative of in-use vehicle emissions in the United States.
