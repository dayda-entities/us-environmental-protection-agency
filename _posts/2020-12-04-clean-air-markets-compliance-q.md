The Compliance Query Wizard is part of a suite of Clean Air Markets-related tools that are accessible at http://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/. The Compliance module provides final compliance results. Using the Compliance Query Wizard, the user can find compliance information associated with specific programs, facilities, states or time frames. Quick Reports and Prepackaged Datasets are also available for data that are commonly requested. Final compliance results are available for all years since 1995 for the Acid Rain Program and for the various NOx trading programs EPA has operated since 1999.

EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) includes several market-based regulatory programs designed to improve air quality and ecosystems. The most well-known of these programs are EPA's Acid Rain Program and the NOx Programs, which reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compounds that adversely affect air quality, the environment, and public health. CAMD also plays an integral role in the development and implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).
