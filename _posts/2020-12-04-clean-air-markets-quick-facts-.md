The Quick Facts and Trends module is part of a suite of Clean Air Markets-related tools that are accessible at https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd.  The Quick Facts and Trends module provides charts and graphs depicting national trends in emissions and heat input. The user can view, for example, data pertaining to the top annual and ozone season emitters of a selected pollutant, the number of units and facilities in a particular state, and trends in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions. EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) includes several market-based regulatory programs designed to improve air quality and ecosystems. The most well-known of these programs are EPA's Acid Rain Program and the NOx Programs, which reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compounds that adversely affect air quality, the environment, and public health. CAMD also plays an integral role in the development and implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).
