EPA's Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) is a geographically-based model that helps policy makers and communities explore data on releases of toxic substances from industrial facilities reporting to EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). By analyzing TRI information together with simplified risk factors, such as the amount of chemical released, its fate and transport through the environment, each chemical’s relative toxicity, and the number of people potentially exposed, RSEI calculates a numeric score, which is designed to only be compared to other scores calculated by RSEI. Because it is designed as a screening-level model, RSEI uses worst-case assumptions about toxicity and potential exposure where data are lacking, and also uses simplifying assumptions to reduce the complexity of the calculations. A more refined assessment is required before any conclusions about health impacts can be drawn. RSEI is used to establish priorities for further investigation and to look at changes in potential impacts over time. Users can save resources by conducting preliminary analyses with RSEI.
