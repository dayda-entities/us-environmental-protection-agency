The Fuel Economy Label and CAFE Data asset contains measured summary fuel economy estimates and test data for light-duty vehicle manufacturers by model for certification as required under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) and The Energy Independent Security Act of 2007 (EISA) to collect vehicle fuel economy estimates for the creation of Economy Labels and for the calculation of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). Manufacturers submit data on an annual basis, or as needed to document vehicle model changes.The EPA performs targeted fuel economy confirmatory tests on approximately 15% of vehicles submitted for validation. Confirmatory data on vehicles is associated with its corresponding submission data to verify the accuracy of manufacturer submissions beyond standard business rules. Submitted data comes in XML format or as documents, with the majority of submissions being sent in XML, and includes descriptive information on the vehicle itself, fuel economy information, and the manufacturer's testing approach. This data may contain proprietary information (CBI) such as information on estimated sales or other data elements indicated by the submitter as confidential. CBI data is not publically available; however, within the EPA data can accessed under the restrictions of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) CBI policy [RCS Link]. Datasets are segmented by vehicle model/manufacturer and/or year with corresponding fuel economy, test, and certification data. Data assets are stored in EPA's Verify system.Coverage began in 1974 with early records being primarily paper documents which did not go through the same level of validation as primarily digital submissions which started in 2008. Early data is available to the public digitally starting from 1978, but more complete digital certification data is available starting in 2008. Fuel economy submission data prior to 2006 was calculated using an older formula; however, mechanisms exist to make this data comparable to current results.Fuel Economy Label and CAFE Data submission documents with metadata, certificate and summary decision information is utilized and made publically available through the EPA/DOE's Fuel Economy Guide Website (http://www.fueleconomy.gov/) as well as EPA's Smartway Program Website (http://www.epa.gov/smartway/) and Green Vehicle Guide Website (http://ofmpub.epa.gov/greenvehicles/Index.do;jsessionid=3F4QPhhYDYJxv1L3YLYxqh6J2CwL0GkxSSJTl2xgMTYPBKYS00vw!788633877) after it has been quality assured. Where summary data appears inaccurate, OTAQ returns the entries for review to their originator.
