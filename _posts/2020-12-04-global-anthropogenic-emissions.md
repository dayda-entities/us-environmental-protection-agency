The data in these Appendices to the Global Anthropogenic Emissions of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases (1990-2020) report provide historical and projected estimates of emissions from over 90 countries and 8 regions for all major non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission sources. The gases included in this data set are methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the high global warming potential (high GWP) gases (hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)). See the full report at http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/international.html.
