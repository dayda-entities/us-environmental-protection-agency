EPAs Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA)  cases and settlements webpage contains links to selected settlements resolving civil enforcement cases and, in some cases, complaints filed initiating civil judicial and administrative enforcement actions.  Typically, the links are to settlements about which we have issued a press release.  This is not a complete repository of all enforcement actions taken by or on behalf of EPA.  Rather, it represents a subset of enforcement cases, taken civil judicially or administratively, which may be of national interest.  Most of the settlements are civil judicial consent decrees resolving alleged violations of environmental laws (e.g., the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act).  In some instances, the website includes significant enforcement actions resolved by the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). In addition, please note that the cases and settlements webpage does not include:Most administrative enforcement actions; Most civil judicial cases resolving liability under CERCLA; Criminal enforcement matters.
