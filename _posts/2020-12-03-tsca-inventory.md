This dataset consists of the non confidential identities of chemical substances submitted under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  TSCA was enacted to ensure that chemicals manufactured,  imported,  processed,  or distributed in commerce,  or used or disposed of in the United States do not pose any unreasonable risks to human health or the environment.  EPA adds chemical substances to the TSCA Inventory following EPAs receipt of a Notice of Commencement (NOC) signaling the manufacturers intent to produce a chemical substance that EPA has previously reviewed and approved. Since EPA published the final TSCA Inventory Reporting Rule on December 23,  1977,  the TSCA Inventory has grown to include the identities of over 83, 000 chemical substances.
