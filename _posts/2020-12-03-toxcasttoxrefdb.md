ToxCast is used as a cost-effective approach for efficiently prioritizing the toxicity testing of thousands of chemicals. It uses data from state-of-the-art high throughput screening (HTS) bioassay and builds computational models to forecast potential chemical toxicity in humans. ToxRefDB stores data related to ToxCast.
