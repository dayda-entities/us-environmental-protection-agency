RadNet-Air is a national network of air monitoring stations that regularly collect air samples for near real time analysis of radioactivity. The data is transmitted to NAREL in Montgomery Alabama. The RadNet-Air network has been used to track environmental releases resulting from nuclear emergencies and to provide baseline data during routine conditions.
